__Finding meaning in your Vim__

Vimdictive is a plugin for dict.org style dictionary and thesaurus
lookups from within Vim.

NOTE: This plugin is still in Alpha; experimenting with ideas.

.Global Maps:

* <leader>dm - Show meaning of word under cursor in the Preview Window.
* <leader>ds - Show synonyms for word under cursor in the Preview Window.
* <leader>df - Set the synonym filter.

.Maps from within the Preview Window:

* <enter> - Show meaning of word under cursor in the Preview Window.
* <backspace> - Show synonyms for word under cursor in the Preview Window.
* <F5> - Refresh Preview Window with most recent query.

The curl approach in this plugin was borrowed from the
https://github.com/szw/vim-dict.git[vim-dict] plugin.
