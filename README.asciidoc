__Finding meaning in your Vim__

Vimdictive is a plugin for dict.org style dictionary and thesaurus
lookups from within Vim.

.Global Maps:

* <leader>dm - Show meaning of word under cursor in the Preview
Window.
* <leader>ds - Show synonyms for word under cursor in the Preview
Window.
* <leader>df - Set the synonym regex filter.
* <leader>dr - Set the synonym rhyme filter.
+
NOTE: The rhyme filter depends on having
http://rhyme.sourceforge.net/[rhyme] installed.

.Maps from within the Preview Window:

* <enter> - Show meaning of word under cursor in the Vimdictive browser (window).
* <backspace> - Show synonyms for word under cursor in the Vimdictive browser.
* q - Close the Vimdictive browser.
* <F5> - Refresh Vimdictive browser with most recent query results.

The curl approach in this plugin was borrowed from the
https://github.com/szw/vim-dict.git[vim-dict] plugin.
